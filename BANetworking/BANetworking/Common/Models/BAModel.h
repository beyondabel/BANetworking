/**
 *  Override this method in subclasses of BAModel to define how to map the content of a dictionary
 *  provided through either the initWithDictionary: initializer or the updateFromDictionary: method.
 *  
 *  The general rules for mapping properties are:
 *  
 *  1. To map a dictionary key to a property, include the property name as the key of the returned dictionary,
 *     and the dictionary key path as the value of the dictionary.
 *  2. If the subclass has an ivar-backed property that matches the name of a dictionary key, it will be
 *     automatically mapped, so no need to explicitly include it in the returned dictionary.
 *  3. To transform a value (e.g. a NSString to an NSDate), implement a class method named '<property>ValueTransformer'
 *     or '<property>ValueTransformerWithDictionary:' that returns an instance of NSValueTransformer for the content.
 *
 *  @return A dictionary mapping the dictionary key paths to property names.
